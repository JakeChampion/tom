# TOM

Yet another TOML parser. Preserves whitespace for real this time!

Work in progress, take a look at [Molten](https://github.com/LeopoldArkham/Molten)
or [toml-edit](https://github.com/ordian/toml_edit) for something relatively more ready.

The best documentation at the moment is [./examples/api-walkthrough.rs](./examples/api-walkthrough.rs).


# Contributing

Contributions are very much welcome! Keep in mind that the code is very much in experimental state,
and so good contributing guides are missing, CI is non-existent, formatting is artisan, etc.
Feel free to ask questions by creating issues/PRs, or by pinging @matklad
at the [Rust discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/442252698964721669/).
